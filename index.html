                    </p>

                    <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                    <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of 
                        transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We 
                        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot 
                        guarantee its absolute security.

                        personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent 
                        or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please

                        information from Our servers.<br><br>
                        If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your 
                        country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We 
                        collect and use that information.
